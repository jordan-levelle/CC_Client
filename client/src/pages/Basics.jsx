        <p>For those needing a refresher on the consensus process, here is a wonderful explanation of the process provided by professional facilitator Tree Bressen.</p>

      <div className="basics-section">
        <h2 className="subsection-title">Main Reasons to Use Consensus as a Decision-Making Method:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>High quality decisions</li>
          <li>Builds connection among members</li>
          <li>More effective implementation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="basics-section">
        <h2 className="subsection-title">Principles</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cooperation is the basis (we all get more of what we want when we cooperate)</li>
          <li>Consensus is for people who are genuinely trying to work together, typically based on some shared interest, purpose or calling; OK if some interests are divergent, as long as sufficient joint interests are present</li>
          <li>Search together for the best solution for the group: it's "us against the problem" we are trying to solve rather than "us against each other"</li>
          <li>Recognize that no decision-making system gets everyone their first choice all the time</li>
          <li>What's the creative way to address all the needs present, rather than lowest common denominator Skills necessary for consensus are also necessary for good relationships</li>
          <li>Consensus seeks to synthesize the wisdom of the group</li>
          <li>Unity (different from unanimous vote or everyone's first choice) "Sense of the meeting"—essence is something you can support or are willing to let go forward, I can live with it</li>
          <li>"Everyone has a piece of the truth"</li>
          <li>Value all kinds of input (rational, emotional, kinesthetic, etc.)</li>
          <li>Consensus is a questioning process, more than an affirming process</li>
          <li>Goal is to thrash out an issue until a good solution is found, rather than make everyone feel good by a fast but fake agreement</li>
          <li>Encourages lifting everyone up to their highest potential, instead of knocking down your opponents</li>
          <li>Share, question, and learn from each other's experience and thinking</li>
          <li>Remember the spirit and process of the system are even more important than the structures</li>
          <li>There is no substitute for being friends with each other</li>
          <li>A positive attitude will get you everywhere</li>
          <li>Meetings should be fulfilling—if they're not, then ask why, and change it!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="basics-section">
        <h2 className="subsection-title">What Helps Consensus Work Well</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Common purpose</li>
          <li>Listening</li>
          <li>Openness to ideas, feelings and experiences of others transformative experience, give & take</li>
          <li>Trust (some degree)</li>
          <li>Willingness to let go of some of your personal attachments in the best interest of the group</li>
          <li>Focus on issues, not personalities—common ownership of ideas focus on interests, not positions, avoid agree/disagree; find reasons or needs behind the positions</li>
          <li>Commitment</li>
          <li>Time—enough to work in depth; patience (but if strong common purpose may decide quickly)</li>
          <li>Preparation: agenda planning, facilitator prep, bringing materials, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="basics-section">
